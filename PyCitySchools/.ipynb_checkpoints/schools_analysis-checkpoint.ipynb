    "Written Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "The data consisted of records of 39170 students in 15 schools.\n",
    "Students took two exams: math and reading. The average reading score was slightly higher (82%) than the average math score (79%). \n",
    "The students who successfully passed math were equal to 75%.\n",
    "The rate of students who passed the reading constituted 86%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall passing score for both exams constituted 65%, meaning that more than a third of the students failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions/comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "When overall passing scores in school are considerably lower than passing percentage in math and reading, it tells us that the student's score distributions are not even. There are low-performing students who need additional attention. You can see seven of such schools on Picture A. Schools Passing Scores: \n",
    "Bailey High School       54.642283\n",
    "Figueroa High School     53.204476\n",
    "Ford High School         54.289887\n",
    "Hernandez High School    53.527508\n",
    "Huang High School        53.513884\n",
    "Johnson High School      53.539172\n",
    "Rodriguez High School    52.988247\n",
    "\n",
    "The schools that are in the top-5 of overall passing rates also have even distribution of students scores in ostudents who successfully passed math and reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).\n",
    "As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school."
